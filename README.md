Express Cache: Efficient Caching and Query Management for Clusters

Express Cache is an advanced application designed to optimize cluster performance by managing query loads intelligently. It can function seamlessly alongside Secret Express or as an independent tool, making it a versatile solution for cluster data management.

Key Features:

1. Synchronized Query Caching: This tool caches query results in sync with the blockchain's block time, effectively reducing redundant data requests and lowering the load on clusters.

2. Dynamic Expiry and Refresh of Data: Express Cache automatically expires outdated cache data and refreshes it with current information, keeping the cache relevant and aligned with the latest blockchain updates.

3. Permanent Archiving for Historical Data: For queries related to specific numbered blocks, Express Cache permanently archives the results, ensuring continuous access to historical data.

4. Efficient Data Retrieval and Export: When data is not available in the cache, Express Cache fetches it promptly, ensuring no query goes unanswered. Additionally, it stores data in an exportable format, simplifying the setup of new "Cache Nodes."

5. Web Interface for Reporting: Express Cache includes a web interface that reports the number of results served from the cache and other insights.

Express Cache is a critical tool for cluster administrators and operators, streamlining data management and improving cluster performance. Its intelligent caching strategy, coupled with the capability to fetch and archive essential data, positions it as an essential component for blockchain load balancers.
